; This is the CX7000 boot configuration file. It is highly recommend to set all network settings within TwinCAT XAE or the website of the device and not to edit this file by hand.
; Comments can be added in lines beginning with a semicolon. However all comments and non supported settings get lost once this file is updated.
; Lines should not exceed 256 characters and all relevant settings should be within 1000 lines.
; If values are not set, the wrong format is used, or if the file is missing, the device will start with the default values.

; Devicename can be a string up to 63 ASCII characters. Permitted chars are 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9' and '-'. The netbios name is derived from the first 15 characters.
